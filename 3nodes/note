Assumption: 
Both source data contain equal number of bits.
Encoding is done at intermediate node i.e. C
Decoding are performed at both the source nodes A & B.

Practical Example:
Source A sends the message "Network Coding is complex and hard."
Source B sends the message "Performing experiments in Interlab."
Node C is the intermediate node which performs XOR operations betweens bits from source A and source B. Node C broadcast the coded message.
Source A decodes the message from source B as and vice versa.
